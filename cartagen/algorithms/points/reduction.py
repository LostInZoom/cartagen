# This file contains point set reduction algorithms, following the classification of point set operators from Bereuter & Weibel (2013).
# A reduction means that there is still a set of points as output of the algorithm, but fewer points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : list of Point
        The points to reduce.
    shrink_ratio : float
        A value between 0 (all points are removed) and 1 (all points are kept).
    centroid : bool, optional
        If set to True, replace the cluster by its centroid.
        If False, replace the cluster by the point closest to the centroid of the cluster.

    Returns

def reduce_points_quadtree(points, depth, mode='simplification', attribute=None):
    """
    Reduce a set of points using a quadtree.

    This algorithm was proposed by Bereuter & Weibel. :footcite:p:`bereuter:2012`
    The quadtree algorithm iteratively divide the point set into four chunks, creating clusters,
    until the depth parameter is reach or only one point remain per cluster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : GeoDataFrame of Point
        The point set to reduce.
    depth : int
        The maximum depth of the quadtree. This acts as a
        selector for the wanted degree of generalisation.
        The lower the value, the more generalised the point set will be.
    mode : str, optional
        There are three available modes:

        - *'selection'* means that for one cell, the algorithm retains
          the point with the largest value in the chosen attribute,
          weighted by the depth of the point. This option requires
          the attribute parameter to be provided.
        - *'simplification'* means that the point retained in the cell
          is the closest to the center of the cell.
        - *'aggregation'* means the points are all aggregated to
          the centroid of the points.
    
    Returns
    -------
    reduced : list of tuple
        The reduced points as tuples composed of three elements:

        #. The geometry of the reduced point.
        #. The index of the point in the initial Geodataframe (-1 if the point was created).
        #. The amount of initial points replaced (which can be used to weight the size of the symbol of this point).
    
    quadtree : QuadTree
        The quadtree object.
