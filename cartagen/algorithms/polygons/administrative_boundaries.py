def boundaries_visvalingam(boundaries, area_tolerance):
    """
    Applies the Visvialingam-Whyatt algorithm to the boundaries of the polygons. As most polygons share their boundaries 
    with another polygon, the simplification is only applied to the common line, so that no topological disconnection is
    created between adjacent polygons.

    The algorithm proposed by Visvalingam and Whyatt :footcite:p:`visvalingam:1993` is used to simplify the boundaries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boundaries : geodataframe of Polygons
        The polygon forming the set of boundaries to simplifiy.
    area_tolerance : float
        The minimum triangle area to keep a vertex in the line.

    Returns
    -------
    geodataframe of Polygons

    Warning
    -------
    This algorithm cannot create multiple polygons, unlike :func:`hull_swinging_arm`.
    Using a length too low can produce an invalid geometry.

    Applies the Raposo algorithm to the boundaries of the polygons. As most polygons share their boundaries

    created between adjacent polygons.

    This algorithm proposed by Raposo :footcite:p:`raposo:2013` simplifies lines based on a
    hexagonal tessellation. The algorithm also works for the simplification of the border of a polygon object.
    The idea of the algorithm is to put a hexagonal tessallation on top of the line to simplify,
    the size of the cells depending on the targeted granularity of the line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boundaries : geodataframe of Polygons
        The polygon forming the set of boundaries to simplifiy.
    initial_scale : float
        Initial scale of the provided line (25000.0 for 1:25000 scale).
    final_scale : float
        Final scale of the simplified line.
    centroid : bool, optional
        If true, uses the center of the hexagonal cells as the new vertex,
        if false, the center is projected on the nearest point in the initial line.
    tobler : bool, optional
        If True, compute cell resolution based on Toblerâ€™s formula, else uses Raposo's formula

    -------
