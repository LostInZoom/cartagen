    """
    Iteratively displace polygons overlapping each other and the provided network.

    Displace the provided buildings if they overlap each other
    or are closer than the width value to the provided networks.
    This method is not deterministic, at each iteration, the algorithm
    select a random angle and a random distance to displace the polygon
    and see if it improves the overlapping issues. Running twice the
    algorithm returns two different solutions.
    This algorithm is succinctly presented in WabiÅ„ski *et al.*
    :footcite:p:`wabinski:2022`

    Parameters
    ----------
    polygons : GeoDataFrame of Polygon
        The buildings to displace.
    networks : list of GeoDataFrame of LineString, optional
        A list of networks the polygons need to be moved away from.
        If left to None, polygons will only be moved away from each other.
    polygon_distance : float, optional
        The minimum acceptable distance between polygons.
    network_distance : float, optional
        The minimum acceptable distance between the polygons
        and the provided networks.
    max_trials : int, optional
        The maximum number of trials before stopping the iteration.
        A trial represent the movement of one polygon that did not
        lower the mean overlapping area between polygons and networks.
    max_displacement : float, optional
        The maximum allowed distance of displacement per iteration.
    network_partioning : GeoDataFrame of LineString, optional
        The network to partition the data with. If provided, each network
        face is treated individually, thus improving performance on larger dataset.

    Returns
    -------
    GeoDataFrame

        Calculates the faces of one or multiple networks.
