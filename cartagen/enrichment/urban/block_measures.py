def measure_block_density(block, buildings, roads):
    """
    Measures the density of the block, i.e. the sum of the areas of the symbols inside the block
    (including the road symbols and the building symbols) divided by the area of the block. The value is usually between 0 and 1 
    but can be bigger than 1 if the block is very dense and scale is small (increasing road symbol size). 
    Parameters
    ----------
    block : a shapely Polygon 
        The polygon represents the measured block, i.e. the face of the road graph.
    buildings : list of shapely Polygon features.
        The geometries of the buildings inside the block.
    roads : list of shapely Polygon features.
        The polygonal symbol of the roads surrounding the block.
        Usually, the symbol width depends on scale.

    ----------
    block : a shapely Polygon 
        The polygon represents the measured block, i.e. the face of the road graph.
    buildings : list of shapely Polygon features.
        The geometries of the buildings inside the block.
    building_min_size : float.
        The minimal area in mÂ² of the buildings at the target scale of generalisation (depends on scale).

    """
    Measures the mean of the overlapping rates for the buildings of the block. The overlapping rate of a building is the ratio between
    the portions of the building overlapping another symbol (road or building), and the are of the building. The value is between 0 and 1 
    where 0 means that no building overlap another building or the road symbol. 
    Parameters
    ----------
    buildings : list of shapely Polygon features.
        The geometries of the buildings inside the block.
    min_sep : float.
        The minimal distance separating two buildings (in meters).
    roads : list of shapely Polygon features.
        The polygonal symbol of the roads surrounding the block.
        Usually, the symbol width depends on scale.
    road_sizes : list of floats
        a lists of symbol widths for all the sections around the block. 
        The list uses the same order as the sections around the block.
