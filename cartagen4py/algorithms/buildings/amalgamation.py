def morphological_amalgamation(buildings, buffer, edge_length):
    """
    Amalgamate buildings using dilation and erosion.
    
    The amalgamation algorithm proposed by Damen *et al.*
    :footcite:p:`damen:2008` is based on morphological dilations and erosions with a square cap.
    It is particularly useful to keep the overall shape of building blocks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buildings : list of Polygon
        Buildings to amalgamate.
    buffer : float
        Size of the buffer used for dilation (in meters).
        Buildings closer than 2 times the buffer size are amalgamated.
    edge_length : float
        Minimum length of edges in the amalgamated geometries
        (a simplification process is carried out).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Polygon

        Calculate urban areas from buildings. Useful for smaller scale maps.
