1. Issues with dual carriageways connected by only one point (cf. carriageway1.png although it's a highway interchange which shouldn't treated as a dual carriageways, this isssue can happen)
2. Issues when a dead-end road is inside the dual carriageway and connected to one of them. For now, dual carriageways with a dead end inside their polygon geometry are not filtered out and are treated as well.
(cf. carriageway2.png)
3. Issues with really complex intersctions (cf. carriageway3.png)
4. Some carriageways are not properly found because their geometry doesn't match the criterias although the context suggests they should have been flagged (cf. carriageway4.png, the carriageway is enclosed by two
carriageways). This issue could be fixed by running a second pass during the dual carriageways detection process.
