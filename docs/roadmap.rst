Roadmap
#######

Here is a list of features we want to include in CartAGen, all of those algorithms are
available in the `Java application <https://github.com/IGNF/CartAGen>`_ but have not been ported yet.

- **Short-term**:

  - GALBE: a process for long and winding road generalisation. :issue:`16`
  - Generalisation (simplification/smoothing) of multiple adjacent polygons while keeping the topology. :issue:`15`

- **Mid-term**:

  - Add meso agents fro AGENT generalisation.
  - Railway generalisation (selection, typification and collapse) from
    `Java. <https://github.com/IGNF/CartAGen/tree/master/cartagen-core/src/main/java/fr/ign/cogit/cartagen/spatialanalysis/network/railways>`_ :issue:`17`
  - Add missing road network generalisation algorithms (more intersection types, complex interchanges, motorway service station/rest areas, etc.)
  - Relief generalisation (contour lines, DEM, etc.)

- **Long-term**:

  - Evaluation algorithms (clutter measures, harmonisation, etc.)
  - `Elastic beams. <https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810500161237>`_
  - `CartACom. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2011.639302>`_

Below, you can see which new features, improvements or bug fixes will be available in the next release.
You can also take a look on the `issue section of the GitHub repository <https://github.com/LostInZoom/cartagen/issues>`_
to have a look on what we currently are working on. Feel free to propose some features you would want in CartAGen as well !
