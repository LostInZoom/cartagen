Roadmap
#######

Here is a list of features we want to include in CartAGen, all of those algorithms are
available in the `Java application <https://github.com/IGNF/CartAGen>`_ but have not been ported yet.

- **Short-term**:

  - GALBE: a process for long and winding road generalisation. :issue:`16`
  - Generalisation (simplification/smoothing) of multiple adjacent polygons while keeping the topology. :issue:`15`

- **Mid-term**:

  - Port railway network generalization from `Java. <https://github.com/IGNF/CartAGen/tree/master/cartagen-core/src/main/java/fr/ign/cogit/cartagen/spatialanalysis/network/railways>`_ :issue:`17`
  - Add missing road network generalisation algorithms (more intersection types, complex interchanges, motorway service station/rest areas, etc.)
  - Collapse parallel railways.

- **Long-term**:

  - Finish AGENT.
  - Typification algorithms for buildings.
  - Add evaluation algorithms (clutter measures, harmonisation, etc.)

Below, you can see which new features, improvements or bug fixes will be available in the next release.
You can also take a look on the `issue section of the GitHub repository <https://github.com/LostInZoom/cartagen/issues>`_
to have a look on what we currently are working on. Feel free to propose some features you would want in CartAGen as well !
