Three are currently available and each of them have a different purpose:

- The `first one <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LostInZoom/cartagen-notebooks/HEAD?filepath=tuto_basemap_creation.ipynb>`_
  aims at providing a look on topographic map generalisation as it involves
  road network simplification, buildings and builsing blocks generalisation
  and much more.

- The `second one <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LostInZoom/cartagen-notebooks/HEAD?filepath=tuto_point_dataset_generalisation.ipynb>`_
  aims at showing the possibilities of CartAGen to handle thematic mapping
  concerning point features visualisation.

- The `third one <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LostInZoom/cartagen-notebooks/HEAD?filepath=algorithm_explaination.ipynb>`_
  aims at providing a lecture support to better understanding the underlying logic
  behind different line generalisation algorithms.
