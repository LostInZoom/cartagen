abstract = { All digitizing methods, as a general rule, record lines with far more data than is necessary for accurate graphic reproduction or for computer analysis. Two algorithms to reduce the number of points required to represent the line and, if desired, produce caricatures, are presented and compared with the most promising methods so far suggested. Line reduction will form a major part of automated generalization. }

abstract = { This paper presents a new approach to line generalisation which uses the concept of 'effective area' for progressive simplification of a line by point elimination. Two coastlines are used to compare the performance of this, with that of the widely used Douglas-Peucker, algorithm. The results from the area-based algorithm compare favourably with manual generalisation of the same lines. It is capable of achieving both imperceptible minimal simplifications and caricatural generalisations. By careful selection of cut-off values, it is possible to use the same algorithm for scale-dependent and scale-independent generalisations. More importantly, it offers scope for modelling cartographic lines as consisting of features within features so that their geometric manipulation may be modified by application- and/or user-defined rules and weights. The paper examines the merits and limitations of the algorithm and the opportunities it offers for further research and progress in the field of line generalisation. }

abstract = { A new method of cartographic line simplification is presented. Regular hexagonal tessellations are used to sample lines for simplification, where hexagon width, reflecting sampling fidelity, is varied in proportion to target scale and drawing resolution. Tesserae constitute loci at which new sets of vertices are defined by vertex clustering quantization, and these vertices are used to compose simplified lines retaining only visually resolvable detail at target scale. Hexagon scaling is informed by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. The hexagonal quantization algorithm is also compared to an implementation of the Li–Openshaw raster-vector algorithm, which undertakes a similar process using square raster cells. Lines produced by either algorithm using like tessera widths are compared for fidelity to the original line in two ways: Hausdorff distances to the original lines are statistically analyzed, and simplified lines are presented against input lines for visual inspection. Results show that hexagonal quantization offers advantages over square tessellations for vertex clustering line simplification in that simplified lines are significantly less displaced from input lines. Visual inspection suggests lines produced by hexagonal quantization retain informative geographical shapes for greater differences in scale than do those produced by quantization in square cells. This study yields a scale-specific cartographic line simplification algorithm, following Li and Openshaw's natural principle, which is readily applicable to cartographic linework. Open-source Java code implementing the hexagonal quantization algorithm is available online. }

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents two pieces of research undertaken at the French National Geographic Institute's (Institut Geographique National, IGN) COGIT laboratory that used multi-agent systems (MAS) to automate the generalization process. These two complementary pieces of work were linked together to build AGIT, which is a generalization research platform based on MAS technology. The work reflects efforts to apply multi-agent systems to map generalization, a core activity within the COGIT laboratory. The concepts of agent and multi-agent systems stem from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The agent paradigm is increasingly being used to solve complex problems in a broad set of domains, from robotic agents to software agents. Automation of the generalization process is one of the main research subjects of the COGIT laboratory. The automation of this process is a real challenge for a NMA that in the short term wishes to reduce costs and time taken to produce series mapping, and in the longer term wants to be able to deliver maps over the Internet, providing generalization on demand.}
