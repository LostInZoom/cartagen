Introduction
============

The user manual aims at providing an **overview** of the cartographic generalisation algorithms proposed by CartAGen.
Some complex algorithms and processes are more deeply explained here than in the API Reference, in particular for
those having several steps.

This section is also designed to help you decide **which algorithm best fit your needs**. Indeed, several generalisation
methods are developped to address the same issue, for example to avoid polygon cluttering or to simplify lines and polygons.
Those issues can also depend on the type of geographic objects you are trying to generalise. For example, maybe you
don't want to simplify rivers and roads the same way, as their representation on the map doesn't have the same constraints.

With that in mind, we tried here to offer here an overview of the algorithms offered by CartAGen in order to help you make
a choice in your cartographic endeavors. Please keep in mind that **this is not a lecture on cartographic generalisation**
nor a full explanation of the generalisation process. We have designed several **Jupyter notebooks** to serve as learning
material, they are accessible `here. <https://github.com/LostInZoom/cartagen-notebooks>`_

Groups of objects
=================

Enrich your data prior to map generalisation
--------------------------------------------

Since the beginning of research on the automation of map generalisation, the necessity for enrichment has been clear. There are properties, structures, which are implicit in the spatial arrangement of geometries in the map. These properties, structures are necessary to make the best decision when generalising the map, and this data enrichment step helps by making these properties, these structures explicit cartographic data.

Extracting implicit geographic structures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: boffet_areas(buildings, dilation_size, erosion_size, simplification_distance = 2)

    Computes the urban/built-up areas from a set of buildings, using a method from Boffet (2000). The algorithm computes buffers around each building ('dilation_size') and then merges all buffers.
    The merged areas are then further refined with an erosion ('erosion_size') and a Douglas & Peucker simplification ('simplification_distance').

.. code-block:: pycon

  # compute the built-up areas with a 25 m buffer and a 10 m erosion
  urbanareas = boffet_areas(polygons, 25.0, 10.0)

.. plot:: code/boffet_areas.py

Measures on map features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: polygon_compactness(polygon)

    Returns the compactness of a ''Polygon'' using the Miller index, i.e. 4.Pi.area / perimeterÂ². This index gives a maximum value of 1 for circles.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (0, 10), (10, 10), (10, 0), (0, 0)])
  >>> polygon_compactness(polygon)
  0.7853981633974483

.. method:: polygon_elongation(polygon)

    Returns the elongation of a ''Polygon'' using the measure from the AGENT project, i.e. the longest edge of the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) divided by the shortest edge of the MBR.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (0, 10), (5, 10), (5, 0), (0, 0)])
  >>> polygon_elongation(polygon)
  2.0

.. method:: building_min_width(building)

    Returns the minimum width inside a building. The minimum width is the minimum distance between two edges of the buildings that are not adjacent. 
    The measure was proposed during the AGENT project. 'building' should be a shapely ''Polygon''.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (0, 10), (2, 10), (2, 6), (5, 6), (5, 0), (0, 0)])
  >>> building_min_width(polygon)
  2.0

AGENT
^^^^^

This user guide is not meant to fully explain the principles of the AGENT model, and how it works. If you are not familiar with the AGENT model, please read the scientific papers describing this model:
- `<http://icaci.org/files/documents/ICC_proceedings/ICC2001/icc2001/file/f13041.pdf>`_
- `<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-008045374-3/50016-8>`_
- `<https://hal.inria.fr/IFSTTAR/hal-01682131v1>`_
Though it is a tutorial for the JAVA CartAGen platform, this `webpage <https://ignf.github.io/CartAGen/docs/tuto_agents.html>`_ also contains complementary information on how to trigger agent-based map generalisation.

Micro agents
=============
You may want to use micro agents only, i.e. one cartographic feature such as a
building that generalises itself without consideration for the other cartographic features.
To generalise micro agents, you have to follow these steps:

  1. Create agent objects from your Geopandas features

  .. code-block:: pycon

    geoms = [loads('Polygon Z ((395038.7 6272970.9, 395030.4 6272984, 395025.3 6272982, 395023.2 6272983.7, 395020 6272981.3, 395016.9 6272985.9, 395021.8 6272990.7, 395020.6 6272993.7, 395024.7 6272997.2, 395028.5 6272994.5, 395032.8 6272988.2, 395038.1 6272991.6, 395044.9 6272979.1, 395047.1 6272980.4, 395049.5 6272976.8, 395038.7 6272970.9))'),
      loads('Polygon Z ((394999.5 6272975, 395006.7 6272962.4, 395010.6 6272957.5, 394996.6 6272944.4, 394991 6272949, 394999.2 6272956.3, 394996.1 6272959.7, 394998.3 6272961.3, 394992 6272969.4, 394999.5 6272975))'),
      loads('Polygon Z ((395007.3 6272975.8, 395013.2 6272981, 395021.2 6272969.6, 395024.2 6272971.9, 395031 6272963.8, 395020.8 6272957.4, 395007.3 6272975.8))'),
      loads('Polygon Z ((395082.3 6272967.4, 395089.9 6272958, 395071.9 6272945.9, 395068.4 6272950.6, 395066 6272949, 395056.3 6272962, 395058.5 6272963.5, 395056.40000000002328306 6272966.8, 395059.4 6272969.9, 395056.9 6272972.6, 395054.5 6272968.3, 395049.6 6272973.4, 395058.4 6272981.6, 395073.6 6272962.5, 395082.3 6272967.4))')
      ]
    envgdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(geometry=geopandas.GeoSeries(geoms))
    for index, feature in envgdf.iterrows():
      agent = BuildingAgent(feature)
  
  2. Add constraints to your agents. You can pick among the constraints provided by the library, but you can also code new constraints and add them to your agents. The list of default constraints is provided in the table below.

  .. list-table:: Building micro constraints
   :widths: 50 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - name
     - property
     - actions
   * - BuildingSizeConstraint
     - area
     - enlarge, delete
   * - BuildingGranularityConstraint
     - granularity
     - simplify, simplify to rectangle
   * - BuildingSquarenessConstraint
     - squareness
     - squaring

  .. code-block:: pycon

    squareness = BuildingSquarenessConstraint(1,agent)
    size = BuildingSizeConstraint(1, agent, 250)
    granularity = BuildingGranularityConstraint(1, agent, 6)
    agent.constraints.append(size)
    agent.constraints.append(squareness)
    agent.constraints.append(granularity)

  3. Run the agents, i.e. start their life cycle iteratively. To run the agents, you have to use: 
  .. method:: run_agents(agents, lifecycle='basic', store_states=False, verbose=0)

    - ''agents'' is a list of agents to run.
    - ''lifecycle'' chooses the type of life cycle to apply on the agents (only the basic is implemented for now)
    - ''store_states'' is True if you want to get all the intermediate states of the agents as output of the function.
    - ''verbose'' defines how much detail is logged during the agents life cycle.
  
  .. code-block:: pycon

    run_agents(agents_to_run)
